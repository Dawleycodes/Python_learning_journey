# Python Learning Journey

This repository documents my journey learning Python from scratch.

I am currently completing daily exercises and mini-projects while building my programming fundamentals for software engineering internships.

## Projects

### Band Name Generator
A beginner program that asks the user for the city they grew up in and their pet name, then combines them to generate a band name.

Skills practiced:
- Variables
- User input
- String concatenation

More projects will be added daily as I progress.
